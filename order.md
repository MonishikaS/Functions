```c
In C, arguments are passed to functions in the order they appear in the function's parameter list.
When you call a function, you provide the actual values or variables that correspond to each parameter in the order they are listed in the function's declaration or definition.

The general syntax for calling a function in C is:
return_type function_name(argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN);

For example, if you have a function sum that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum, you would call it like this:
#include <stdio.h>

int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = sum(x, y); // Arguments are passed in the order a, b
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

In this example, the sum function takes two parameters (a and b). When we call the sum function in the main function, we pass the values of x and y as arguments in the order they are defined in the function's parameter list.

It is crucial to ensure that the number and types of arguments passed in the function call match the function's declaration or definition.
If the function expects more or fewer arguments or if the types of the arguments don't match, it will lead to a compilation error or unexpected behavior during runtime.
