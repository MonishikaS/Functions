```c
In C, a library function refers to a pre-defined function that is provided by the C standard library or additional libraries.
These functions are already implemented and can be used in your C programs without the need to write their code from scratch.
C standard library functions cover a wide range of functionalities, from basic I/O operations to complex mathematical computations.

To use a library function in your C program, you need to include the appropriate header file that declares the function you want to use.
The most commonly used header file is <stdio.h>, which includes functions for standard input and output.
Other libraries are included as needed, based on the functionality required.

Here are some examples of commonly used C standard library functions:

1.Input/Output Functions (<stdio.h>):

printf(): To print formatted output to the console.
scanf(): To read formatted input from the console.
getchar(): To read a single character from the console.
putchar(): To print a single character to the console.

2.Mathematical Functions (<math.h>):

sqrt(): To calculate the square root of a number.
sin(), cos(), tan(): Trigonometric functions.
ceil(), floor(): To round a number up or down to the nearest integer.

3.String Functions (<string.h>):

strlen(): To find the length of a string.
strcpy(), strncpy(): To copy strings.
strcat(), strncat(): To concatenate strings.

4.Memory Functions (<stdlib.h>):

malloc(), calloc(): To dynamically allocate memory.
free(): To release dynamically allocated memory.

5.File I/O Functions (<stdio.h>):

fopen(), fclose(): To open and close files.
fread(), fwrite(): To read and write data to files.

6.Character Functions (<ctype.h>):

isalpha(), isdigit(), isalnum(): To check character properties.

7.Date and Time Functions (<time.h>):

time(): To get the current time in seconds.
ctime(): To convert a time value to a string.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more functions available in C standard library and other libraries.
It's important to include the appropriate header files at the beginning of your C program to access the functions you want to use.
The functions in these libraries make C programming more efficient and convenient by providing ready-to-use solutions for common tasks.
