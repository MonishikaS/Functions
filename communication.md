In C, functions can communicate with each other through parameters and return values. Here are the main ways functions can interact:

Passing parameters: Functions can receive data from other functions by accepting parameters. 
Parameters are variables declared within the function's parentheses during function definition. When the function is called, the actual values (arguments) are passed to the function, and these values are stored in the parameters. 
The function can then use these parameter values to perform operations.
Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = add(x, y); // Function call with parameters
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

Return values: Functions can return data back to the calling function using the return statement. The return type of the function is specified in the function declaration. 
When the function is called, it can perform some operations and return the result using the return statement. The caller can capture this returned value and use it as needed.
Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = add(x, y); // Function call with return value
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

```

Global variables: While not recommended for most situations due to potential side effects and poor code maintainability, functions can also communicate through 
global variables. Global variables are declared outside of any function and can be accessed and modified by any function in the same C file.
Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int globalVar = 0;

void incrementGlobalVar() {
    globalVar++;
}

int main() {
    incrementGlobalVar();
    printf("The value of the global variable is: %d\n", globalVar);
    return 0;
}

```
It is crucial to design your code with proper encapsulation and minimal reliance on global variables to maintain code readability and avoid potential issues with side effects.

Remember that passing parameters and returning values is the preferred way to communicate between functions as it promotes a more modular and structured approach to programming.
