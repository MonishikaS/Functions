In C, the return type of a function is a crucial part of the function's declaration. It specifies the type of data that the function will return to the caller when it is executed. 
The return type is specified in the function prototype during its declaration and also in the function definition. 
The syntax for declaring the return type of a function is as follows:
```c
return_type function_name(parameters);
```
Here, return_type is the data type of the value that the function will return, function_name is the identifier for the function, and parameters are the optional input values 
that the function can accept.

Some common return types in C include:
1.void: Indicates that the function does not return any value. These functions are often used for performing actions or operations without producing a result.
Example:
```c
void displayMessage() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

```
Data types (e.g., int, float, double, char, etc.): Functions can return various data types, depending on the computation they perform and the type of data they generate.
Example:
```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

float divide(float a, float b) {
    return a / b;
}
```
Pointers: Functions can also return pointers, which are memory addresses pointing to other data types.
Example:
```c
int* createIntArray(int size) {
    int* arr = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    // Initialize the array or perform other operations
    return arr;
}
```
It is essential to ensure that the return type specified in the function declaration matches the actual data type returned by the function in its definition. 
If the function declaration and definition do not match, it will lead to a compilation error. 
Additionally, when a function returns a value, it is essential for the caller to capture and use that value appropriately.
